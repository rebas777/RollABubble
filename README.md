# RollABubble
- A VR puzzle solving game(Unity + HTC VIVE)
- Developed for “ID@Xbox Dream Campus” Game Development Competition
- Developed by **Zoltan Jin** (rebas777) and **Junyi Liu** (Jim3060)

## Intension
The core idea -- as well as the creative point -- of this game is the control mechanism. Lots of the first person VR games share the same control mechanism -- users have to aim at a certain point by the VR controller and then press a button in order to move to that point. However, in this game, our character is a bubble which will just roll to move around. Our users will **circle the VR controller** in order to force the bubble to roll.

The most surprising puzzle of all is a clock-time-shadow system. Player can control a clock by swinging their arms and thus to change sunlight direction. When the sunlight is in a certain direction, **some of our objects in the scene together with their shadows will format a hinted pattern**, which will enable player to reach the final goal.
